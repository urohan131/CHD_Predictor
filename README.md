# Heart Disease prediction using Machine Learning.
The project focus on training Logistic regression model to predict the risk of Coronary heart disease(CHD) in time of 10 years with help of demographic information , behavioral factors and medical history.

What is Logistic Regression ?

Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning techniques classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields . It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes . It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.

# About the data:
The "Framingham" heart disease dataset includes over 4,240 records,16 columns and 15 attributes. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease

Variables included in the dataset:


Demographic Information:-
1. `sex`: Male or Female (Binary)
2. `age`: Age of the patient (Continuous)

Behavioral Factors:-

3. `education`: levels coded 1 for some high school, 2 for a high school diploma or GED, 3 for some college or vocational school, and 4 for a college degree.
4. `currentSmoker`: whether or not the patient is a current smoker(Binary)
5. `cigsPerDay`: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day(Continuous)

Medical History:

6. `BPMeds`: Whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Binary)
7. `prevalentStroke`: Whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke(Binary)
8. `prevalentHyp`: Whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Binary)
9. `diabetes`: Whether or not the patient had diabetes (Binary)

Current Medical Information:

10. `totChol`: Total cholesterol level (Continuous)
11. `sysBP`: Systolic blood pressure (Continuous)
12. `diaBP`: Diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)
13. `BMI`: Body Mass Index (Continuous)
14. `heartRate`: Heart rate (Continuous)
15. `glucose`: Glucose level (Continuous)

Predict Variable (Desired Target):

16. `TenYearCHD`: 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD *(TARGET VARIABLE)

#Libraries Used:
  1. Pandas *(for data manipulation)*
  2. Scikit-Learn *(for data modeling)*
